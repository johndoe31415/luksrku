luksrku
=======

**Warning** luksrku is currently *highly* experimental software. It is not
intended for production use yet. It is released following the "release early,
release often" philosophy in the hope to get valuable feedback for possible
areas of improvement. Please only use it when you're pretty certain that you
know what you're doing. Better yet, only use it after code review. If you've
reviewed my code, please let me know. I'm very interested in any and all
feedback. Drop it at joe@johannes-bauer.com, please. Thanks!
